# QDriverStation

This project creates a working snap of the QDriverStation, which is an cross-platform and open-source alternative to the FRC Driver Station. It allows the operation of (but not limited to) FRC robots.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - add custom launcher
 - build from current git

## Current state

Working features:

- The application itself is compiled, installed and executed successfully

Known issues:

- Audio & joystick input does not work.
- The application cannot access CPU and Battery information.
