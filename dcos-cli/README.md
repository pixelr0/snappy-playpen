# DC/OS CLI snap

This project creates a working snap for Mesos DC/OS CLI.
It is another fast moving CLI client for a fast moving cloud system.
It's written in python, which showed to be really easy to snap.

## Current state

Working features:
 - The snap is build and the binary works.

Known issues:
 - None, but needs to be tested with a DC/OS server.

Unknowns:
 - I haven't tried most of the features.
