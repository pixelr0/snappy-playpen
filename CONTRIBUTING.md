# Contributing to Snappy Playpen

Snappy Playpen is a learning project, so we don't place too many restrictions
on the projects add to it. For your project to be added, it is important that:

 - it builds by just running `snapcraft cleanbuild` in the directory
 - you add a `README.md` file to your directory which explains
   - what your project is about
   - what others can learn from it
   - what the level of completion is
   - what still needs to be done
 - you update the software table in the top-level `README.md` file and
   indicate with either `:white_check_mark:` (working) or `:red_circle:` (not
   working) what the status of your snap is

Please note that we are going to consider removing a non-working snap from the
repo if we can't get it to work after a month without updates.

Use `snap-template` with our formatted `README.md` to kickstart your project.
